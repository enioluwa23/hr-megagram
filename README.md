## Description

[The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/H/Hertzsprung-Russell+Diagram) is a graph used in the study of stellar evolution. It describes the relationship between the temperature and the luminosity of stars and how that relates to their age, mass, diameter and stage of life. However, this graph is usually presented in a static form which limits the ability for a learner to understand how it works.

This web app serves as an interactive form of the graph that provides estimated properties of stars based on their position in the diagram. It also helps to understand how the spectral classification changes as stars move along the diagram. I developed this for a presentation in my Light & Sound Physics class. Made with [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Roadmap

This graph is currently missing numerical demarcations which are planned to be added.

An extra feature that would add to the educational value of this tool is to enable simulations for different types of stars along the diagram, such as how main-sequence (<8M<sub>☉</sub>) stars evolve from protostars to white dwarves, and how that eolution differs for higher mass stars.
